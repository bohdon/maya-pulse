                     Connect Only: only connect the offset parent matrix, keep all other attributes the same
                     Snap: zero out all relative transform values once connected
                     Keep World: restore the previous world position once connected, modifying relative transform values if necessary
                     Create Offset: create an offset to preserve the current world position, as well as the current relative transform values"
